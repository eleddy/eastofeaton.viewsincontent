About
-----
Embeds a browser view in a custom content view. If the view has an id of "content", 
automatically strips the html to only include that text. 


Use Case
--------
If you have a site with browser views that do super dynamic things, but you want 
to be able to move them around throughout a site just like a content object. E.g. 
you want to generate graphs, but you want them to be listed in the sitemap.


Warning
-------
You probably don't want to use this. It's probably the hackiest thing I have ever
done. I'm sure there is a better way. But it works.
